# RAG-Fundamentals
A hands-on implementation of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using Weaviate vector database, built while learning from scratch.

## What's in this repo

- **Weaviate Vector DB pipeline** — chunking text, indexing into Weaviate, and performing semantic search

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Weaviate
- Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

## Concepts Covered
- Text chunking with overlap (sliding window)
- Converting text to vector embeddings
- Indexing documents into a vector database
- Semantic search using cosine similarity
- HNSW indexing

## How to Run
```bash
pip install weaviate-client sentence-transformers
python weaviate_rag.py
```
